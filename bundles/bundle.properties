sector.rubiginosus-miss1.name = Dividing Titanium
sector.rubiginosus-miss1.description = [gold]Mission 1: Dividing Titanium.\n\n[white]The United Earth and the League of Independant States are fighting for control of the titanium within this area. It is your time to take command. Defend our newly established colony and take over their titanium mines to the East. A mercenary force was also hired to hinder our progress.\n\n[gray][Mod Author Notes: This is a hardcore seperate campaign initially designed for multiplayer play, heavily inspired from Rusted Warfare, before being ported into a modded campaign. This planet uses Serpulo and Erekir technology. It is recommended to have researched most of the relevant tech trees before engaging with the campaign. The quality of the maps are not assured, but improve with every map.]

The quality of the maps do get better after this.]
